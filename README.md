Local BLE control of supported Govee LED strips from Home Assistant, with no cloud dependency.

## Supported Devices

All models support on/off, brightness, RGB color, color temperature, and state readback.

- **H617A**: LED Strip · 83 scenes · 11 music modes
- **H6199**: DreamView T1 · 240 scenes · video and music modes · advanced controls

## Version 6 migration

Version 6 replaces the custom frontend and parallel mode controls with Home Assistant's native light effect selector.
Effect families are configured from the integration options. H617A enables Scenes and Music by default, while H6199
enables Video by default.

Timers, saved custom effects, the active-mode sensor and the old mode services have been removed. Segment painting
remains available through the `paint_segments`, `set_segment_color` and `set_segment_brightness` entity services.
