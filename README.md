Local BLE control of supported Govee LED strips from Home Assistant, with no cloud dependency.

## Supported Devices

All models support on/off, brightness, RGB color, color temperature, and state readback.

- **H617A**: LED Strip · 83 scenes · 11 music modes
- **H6199**: DreamView T1 · 240 scenes · video and music modes · advanced controls

## Version 6 migration

Version 6 replaces the custom frontend and parallel mode controls with Home Assistant's native light effect selector.
Effect families are configured from the integration options. H617A enables Scenes and Music by default, while H6199
enables Video by default.

Timers, saved custom effects, the active-mode sensor and the old mode services have been removed. Segment painting
remains available through the `paint_segments`, `set_segment_color` and `set_segment_brightness` entity services.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS** → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/teh-hippo/ha-govee-led-ble` as **Integration**
3. Install **Govee LED BLE** and restart Home Assistant

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/ha_govee_led_ble/` into your HA `custom_components/` directory and restart.

## Beta versions

Preview builds are published from the `segments` branch as [GitHub pre-releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository/about-releases), tagged `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`. Stable installs never see them.

To opt in, open the integration in HACS, choose **Redownload** from the three-dot menu, and enable **Show beta versions**. Turn it off and redownload to return to the stable channel.

## Configuration

The integration auto-discovers nearby supported devices.

To add manually in Home Assistant:

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Govee LED BLE**

## Dashboards

Example stock Lovelace dashboards live in [`docs/dashboards/`](docs/dashboards/). The integration uses standard Home
Assistant light controls and effect selectors.

## Development

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
```

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
